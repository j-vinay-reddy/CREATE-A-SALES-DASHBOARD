📊 Sales KPI Dashboard Report – Detailed Analysis
This Sales KPI Dashboard provides a comprehensive, data-driven overview of the organization’s sales performance. It combines high-level metrics, revenue analysis, marketing effectiveness, customer behavior, and trend monitoring to deliver powerful business insights. Here's a deep dive into the various elements of the dashboard and the insights they reveal.

🔢 High-Level Performance Metrics (KPIs)
The top section of the dashboard highlights four critical KPIs:
Number of Sales: 115
This represents the total transactions completed in the last period.
The downward arrow (🔻4%) and calendar symbol (🔻5%) indicate a decline both compared to the previous period and the same period last year. This highlights a short-term and seasonal drop, possibly due to decreased market demand or less effective campaigns.


Revenue: $150,009


Revenue is a central indicator of business health.


The 9% drop compared to the prior period and 4% drop year-over-year suggest a need to investigate root causes—e.g., pricing strategy, customer churn, or lower sales volumes.


Profit: $39,709


While still positive, profit has dipped by 1% from the last period and a more noticeable 11% compared to the same time last year.


This discrepancy implies rising costs or reduced margins, requiring an in-depth analysis of pricing and operational efficiency.


Cost: $110,300


Costs have increased by 12% (short-term) but remained fairly steady YoY (1% increase).


The short-term cost rise might stem from increased marketing expenses or operational costs, as partially evidenced in the cost breakdown.



📈 Sales Revenue Trends
The stacked area chart titled "Sales Revenue" shows a steady growth in revenue across 2018, with two primary segments:
New Customers (Darker Green)


Up/Cross-Selling (Lighter Green)


This indicates:
A healthy pipeline of new customers, though growth fluctuates.


An increase in revenue from existing customers through up/cross-sell strategies, which is a good sign for retention and product/service expansion.


There is a visible spike toward the end of the year (likely seasonal or promotional), suggesting strategic sales peaks that could be replicated or optimized further.

💰 Cost Breakdown
The donut chart shows how costs are split between Marketing (33%) and Sales (67%), with monetary values of:
Marketing: $73,450


Sales: $36,850


Despite the higher share in marketing, overall marketing spend is still lower than sales. The return on this investment must be assessed by comparing it to lead conversion and incremental sales contribution (see below).

📦 Incremental Sales Channels
This horizontal bar chart presents Incremental Sales by channel:
Email, GDN, Instagram, Facebook, Google Ads, Twitter


Key Insight:
Facebook leads by a large margin, bringing in over $400,000 in incremental sales.


Email and Google Ads perform moderately well.


Twitter and GDN contribute the least, suggesting potential areas for optimization or budget reallocation.


This informs marketing strategy decisions—invest more in top-performing channels and reconsider budget spent on low-return platforms.

🔁 Up/Cross-Sell Performance
Revenue from Up/Cross-Sell: $16,501


% of Revenue: 11%


This metric reveals that 11% of total revenue is derived from customers purchasing additional products or services—an encouraging sign that current customers see ongoing value. This tactic should be nurtured further with personalized offerings and customer engagement strategies.

🔄 Customer Churn Metrics
Churned Customers: 26


Churn Rate: 2%


Revenue Lost from Churn: $43,812


A 2% churn rate is relatively low and indicates good customer retention. However, the revenue impact is significant, with over $43K lost. This suggests that churned customers may be high-value accounts. Proactive retention strategies like loyalty programs, customer success outreach, or product improvements should be explored.

📉 Accumulated Revenue Waterfall
This waterfall chart visualizes revenue movement:
Starts with previous revenue


Adds new revenue and upsell


Subtracts lost revenue (due to churn or cancellations)


Ends with Current Revenue


This visualization clearly shows which factors contributed positively or negatively. For instance:
Upselling and new customer revenue drive growth.


Lost revenue, while small, still erodes gains—highlighting the importance of retention.



📌 Summary of Key Insights
📉 Revenue and profit have dipped, prompting analysis into sales performance and cost structure.


🧲 Facebook ads deliver high incremental sales and justify continued investment.


🔄 Churn is under control by rate but significant by revenue impact—high-value customers are being lost.


💡 Up/Cross-sell programs are effective but have room to grow beyond 11% revenue contribution.


📊 Cost allocation shows a heavier investment in marketing, which must be tied back to ROI clearly.


📈 End-of-year sales spike suggests a seasonal opportunity to double down on promotional campaigns.



✅ Final Recommendations
Perform a channel ROI analysis to optimize ad spend.


Investigate profit margins—look into rising operational or marketing costs.


Build on successful up/cross-sell strategies with more personalization.


Implement churn prediction models to proactively retain high-value customers.


Align sales and marketing initiatives around periods of peak activity.
This dashboard serves as a powerful tool for strategic planning and decision-making. With the right follow-up actions, the company can turn the current dip in performance into future growth opportunities.
